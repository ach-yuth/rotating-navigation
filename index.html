        <h1>Freedom from known</h1>
        <small>Jiddu krishnamurty</small>
        <p>
          Freedom from the Known is one of Krishnamurti's most accessible works.
          Here, he reveals how we can free ourselves radically and immediately
          from the tyranny of the expected. By changing ourselves, we can alter
          the structure of society and our relationships. The vital need for
          change and the recognition of its very possibility form an essential
          part of this important books message.

          Jiddu Krishnamurti (born 1895, Madanapalle, India—died 1986, Ojai,
          Calif., U.S.) Indian spiritual leader. He was educated in theosophy by
          the British social reformer Annie Besant, who proclaimed him the
          coming “World Teacher,” a messianic figure who would bring about world
          enlightenment. He became a teacher and writer, and from the 1920s he
          spent much time in the United States and Europe. In 1929 he broke with
          the Theosophical Society, the international religious organization run
          by Besant, and renounced any claims to being the World Teacher.
          Proclaiming the necessity of total spiritual freedom (even from
          teachers) through unflinching self-awareness, he continued to be a
          popular lecturer. He established Krishnamurti foundations in the
          United States, Britain, India, Spain, and Canada to further his aims.
          His books include The Songs of Life (1931) and Commentaries on Living
          (1956–60).
